We have   embedded person-centered support in our mission to ensure all staff treat our participants the way they would like to be treated. Participants are given the freedom to make their own delivery choices and are provided access to their preferred health services. Participants are treated with respect and empathy. our staff actively listen to their life story to understand their values, culture, interests, and beliefs. We then incorporate this information into the support plans. Strong connections between people, family, friends, and their community are encouraged so that participants can enjoy greater safety, independence and an enhanced quality of life. Participants are supported to integrate within their community, with family and friends, in a manner that assists them to meet their goals by having their views and input valued, which is their legal and human right.
